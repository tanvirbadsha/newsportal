Inspired by a concerted batting effort from the likes of Shakib Al Hasan, Liton Das, Tamim Iqbal and Yasir Ali, Bangladesh secured a 38-run victory over South Africa
in the first ODI in Centurion today. The convincing win at the SuperSport Park, that helped Bangladesh take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, was also the Tigers'
maiden win away to South Africa in any format. Before this win, Bangladesh lost all the nine ODIs, six Tests and four T20Is played against South Africa in their
back
